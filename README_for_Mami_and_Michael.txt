こんにちはMamiとMichael.

* Why is "bilingual news" in brackets? You're bilingual and they should both probably be front and center.

* You guys should add a favicon to your website! :)

* Add instagram, twitter, facebook, android, ios icons to your website

* For the mockup, I used a google font called "Roboto" because it's similar to Helvetica/Arial, but is free and isn't as hipster-y in my opinion.
Refer to: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,400i,700" rel="stylesheet">

* I chose the green because you guys like the environment (like me) and the image of a Ginkgo tree came to mind. I chose blue because I like/do Indigo dyeing (a lot), and the orange is just becuz I really want to eat a mikan right now.

* I don't own the cat image. Google image search and photoshop baby. 

* I took inspiration from here: http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ (not a huge redux fan - I guess I get what it's for, but it's totally めんどくさい for one person apps - but the design of their docs is really nice)

Thanks for the podcast and for reading this, if you did in the end.

Best,
